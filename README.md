#  Port-scanning-basics
Conducted network reconnaissance by scanning local network IP ranges using Nmap TCP SYN scan to identify open ports and running services. Analyzed scan results for potential security risks and documented findings. Developed foundational network security exposure assessment skills.
#  Steps Performed
- Installed Nmap and wireshark
- Identified network range (e.g., 192.168.1.6/24).
- Ran TCP SYN scan and saved outputs.
- Researched discovered open ports and associated services.
- Captured and analyzed packets with Wireshark.
- Summarized findings and provided mitigation suggestions.
